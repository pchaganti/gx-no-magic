# === CONSTANTS AND HYPERPARAMETERS ===

# Model architecture — deliberately identical to microgpt for controlled comparison.
# The ONLY architectural difference is causal vs. bidirectional attention.
N_EMBD = 16         # embedding dimension (d_model, same as microgpt)
N_HEAD = 4          # number of attention heads
N_LAYER = 1         # transformer blocks
BLOCK_SIZE = 16     # maximum sequence length (names are short, 16 is sufficient)
HEAD_DIM = N_EMBD // N_HEAD  # 4 dimensions per head

# Training parameters
LEARNING_RATE = 0.02
BETA1 = 0.85
BETA2 = 0.99
EPS_ADAM = 1e-8
NUM_STEPS = 3000

# Signpost: BERT needs more steps than microgpt (1000) because only ~25% of tokens
# contribute to the loss per step. With names averaging ~6 chars, that's 1-2 masked
# tokens per example — the model gets far fewer gradient signals per step.

# MLM parameters
MASK_PROB = 0.25    # fraction of tokens to mask per training example
# Signpost: BERT's original uses 15% masking with an 80/10/10 split (80% [MASK], 10% random
# token, 10% unchanged). We use 25% pure [MASK] — higher than standard to give the tiny model
# more gradient signals per step. At toy scale, 15% of a 6-char name is often just 1 token.

# Data parameters
DATA_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karpathy/makemore/master/names.txt"
DATA_FILE = "names.txt"

# Signpost: Same ~4,200 parameters as microgpt. Production BERT-base has 110M parameters
# across 12 layers. The architecture scales identically — this toy version proves the
# mechanism works before you burn a GPU cluster.

    THE CRITICAL DIFFERENCE FROM MICROGPT:
    microgpt processes tokens one-at-a-time with an incremental KV cache, building

    don't exist yet). BERT processes ALL tokens simultaneously and computes attention
    over the FULL sequence — every token attends to every other token, including those
    that come after it.

    This bidirectional attention is why BERT excels at understanding tasks (classification,
    NER, question answering) — it can use full context to understand each token. But it
    can't generate text autoregressively because seeing the full sequence during training
    means it has no concept of "left-to-right" generation.

  Key insight: The ONLY difference is causal masking. Same attention mechanism,
  same projections, same MLP — but removing the causal constraint transforms a
  text generator into a text understander. This is why modern systems often use
  BOTH: an encoder (BERT-like) for understanding and a decoder (GPT-like) for
  generation (e.g., T5, the original Transformer).
